              </li>
              <li>
                This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of
                these restrictions and may be terminated by Quabynah Codelabs at
                any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or
                upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any

            <h3>3. Disclaimer</h3>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                The materials on Quabynah Codelabs' website are provided on an
                'as is' basis. Quabynah Codelabs makes no warranties, expressed
                or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other
                warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or
                conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
                or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation
                of rights.
              </li>
              <li>
                Further, Quabynah Codelabs does not warrant or make any
                representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or
                reliability of the use of the materials on its website or
                otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to

            <p>
              In no event shall Quabynah Codelabs or its suppliers be liable for
              any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of
              data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of
              the use or inability to use the materials on Quabynah Codelabs'

              authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing
              of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do
              not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of
              liability for consequential or incidental damages, these
              limitations may not apply to you.

              Codelabs does not warrant that any of the materials on its website
              are accurate, complete or current. Quabynah Codelabs may make
              changes to the materials contained on its website at any time
